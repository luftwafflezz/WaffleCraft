# WaffleCraft
A modpack based around ImmersivePortals that focuses on improving the Minecraft experience while staying optimized
WaffleCraft is a modpack that aims to shape the Minecraft experience into something cool. This pack revolves around one mod, Immersive Portals, with other technology mods added as well. Sodium is included for performance, and Iris has been added so you can use shaders (I recommend BSL shaders because it is compatible with Distant Horizons and Immersive Portals).

## Notice
Shaders may not work if you have dimension stack enabled in Immersive Portals
